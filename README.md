# Dash Enterprise Continuous Deployment

This repo houses example scripts for deploying to Dash Enterprise using pipelines via various YAML scripts.

Each day a shell script writes a new Dash app with the date and time in the header and pushes that app, via various services, to [Dash Enterprise](https://dash-customer-success.plotly.host/Portal/).
